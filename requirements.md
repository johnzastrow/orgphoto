● Summary

  Implemented intelligent master file selection system and enhanced log formatting:

  Version 2.0.1 - Enhanced Log Formatting:

  1. Professional Session Headers:
  - Enhanced log file headers with structured formatting
  - Clear version information in each session
  - Session start/end timestamps with visual separators
  - Improved readability with 80-character separator lines
  - Blank lines between sessions for better organization

  Log Format Example:
  ```
  ================================================================================
  orgphoto - Photo Organization Tool
  Version: 2.0.1 (Release Date: 2025-10-14)
  Session Started: 2025-10-14 09:00:22
  ================================================================================
  ```

  Version 2.0.0 - Intelligent Master File Selection (MAJOR UPDATE):

  1. Master File Selection Algorithm:
  - Priority 1: No duplicate keywords (highest priority)
    * Detects: copy, duplicate, version, backup, alt, alternative
    * International: copie, kopie, copia
    * Numbered patterns: (1), (2), _copy_1, _duplicate_001
  - Priority 2: Shortest filename (simpler names preferred)
  - Priority 3: Oldest creation/modification date (originals first)

  2. Smart Duplicate Keyword Detection:
  - Word-based keywords: copy, duplicate, version, backup, etc.
  - Numbered duplicates at end of filename only (avoids timestamp false positives)
  - Regular expressions for pattern matching: \(\d+\)$, _copy_?\d+$, etc.
  - International variations supported

  3. Automatic File Demotion:
  - When incoming file is better master, existing files are demoted
  - Demoted files moved according to duplicate handling mode
  - Redirect mode: Files moved to Duplicates/ directory
  - Rename mode: Files renamed in place with duplicate keyword
  - Hash cache updated automatically during demotion

  4. Master File Protection:
  - Master files protected from being overwritten
  - Even in "overwrite" mode, masters are preserved
  - Inferior duplicates renamed or redirected instead
  - Prevents accidental data loss of original files

  5. Comprehensive Logging:
  - Master selection decisions logged with criteria
  - Demotion actions tracked with source and destination
  - Conflict reasons detailed (filename, content, or both)
  - All actions logged to events.log for audit trail

  Usage Examples:

  # Master selection with default skip mode
  python op.py -c -D skip -j jpg source/ target/
  # Incoming inferior duplicates skipped, existing master protected

  # Master selection with redirect mode
  python op.py -c -D redirect -R Duplicates -j jpg source/ target/
  # Incoming becomes master, existing demoted to Duplicates/

  # Master selection with rename mode
  python op.py -c -D rename -K old -j jpg source/ target/
  # Best file selected as master, others renamed with "old" keyword

  How Master Selection Works:

  1. Duplicate Detection: SHA-256 hash or filename conflict detected
  2. Candidate Evaluation: All conflicting files (incoming + existing) scored
  3. Master Selection: Lowest score wins (no keywords=0, has keywords=1, then by length, then by date)
  4. Action Determination:
     - If incoming is master: Demote existing files, place incoming
     - If existing is master: Protect master, handle incoming per mode
  5. Execution: Files moved/renamed, hash cache updated, actions logged

  Log Output Example:

  ```
  DUPLICATE CONFLICT: photo.jpg matches existing file target/2023_01_15/photo_copy.jpg (reason: identical content)
  MASTER SELECTION: Chose photo.jpg as master (incoming)
    Criteria: has_dup_keywords=False, name_length=9, date=2023-01-15 10:30:00
    Non-masters (1): ['photo_copy.jpg']
  MASTER PROMOTION: Incoming file photo.jpg is the better master
    DEMOTION: photo_copy.jpg will be moved to duplicate location
    DEMOTED: photo_copy.jpg -> Duplicates/photo_copy_duplicate.jpg
  photo.jpg  2023-01-15 10:30:00 copied target/2023_01_15 [PROMOTED TO MASTER]
  ```

  Key Features Delivered:

  ✅ Three-tier master selection algorithm (keywords > length > date)
  ✅ Smart duplicate keyword detection with international support
  ✅ Automatic file demotion when better master arrives
  ✅ Master file protection from inferior duplicates
  ✅ Comprehensive logging of all decisions and actions
  ✅ Integration with all duplicate handling modes
  ✅ Hash cache management during demotions
  ✅ Professional log formatting with session headers
  ✅ Full documentation in README.md and CLAUDE.md

  Technical Implementation:

  - `has_duplicate_keywords()`: Detects duplicate markers in filenames
  - `calculate_master_score()`: Scores files based on three criteria
  - `select_master_file()`: Determines master among all candidates
  - Enhanced `handle_file_operation()`: Implements master-aware processing
  - Demotion logic: Moves files and updates hash cache atomically
  - Protected operations: Masters cannot be overwritten accidentally

  The intelligent master file selection system transforms orgphoto from a simple duplicate detector
  into an intelligent file organizer that automatically identifies and preserves original files
  while properly categorizing copies and duplicates. This is a major architectural enhancement
  that fundamentally improves how the application handles complex duplicate scenarios.

● Summary

  I have successfully implemented the redirect option for duplicate files with the following features:

  New Redirect Functionality:

  1. New CLI Options Added:
  - -D redirect or --duplicate-handling redirect - Enable redirect mode
  - -R DIR or --redirect-dir DIR - Specify redirect directory (default: "Duplicates")
  - -K WORD or --duplicate-keyword WORD - Specify duplicate keyword (default: "duplicate")

  2. Intelligent Duplicate Redirection:
  - Default behavior: Creates Duplicates/ directory in target root
  - Custom directory: Supports both relative and absolute paths with -R
  - Smart renaming: Uses configurable keyword (default "duplicate")
  - Incremental numbering: Handles multiple duplicates with photo_duplicate_001.jpg, photo_duplicate_002.jpg, etc.
  - Comprehensive detection: Works with both filename conflicts and SHA256-detected duplicates

  3. Integration with Existing Systems:
  - Works with comprehensive checking: Redirects true duplicates detected by SHA256
  - Works with traditional checking: Redirects filename conflicts
  - Interactive mode support: User can choose redirect option when prompted
  - Logging: Clear indication of redirect actions in logs

  Usage Examples:

  # Basic redirect - duplicates go to target/Duplicates/
  python op.py -c -D redirect -j jpg source/ target/

  # Custom redirect directory and keyword
  python op.py -c -D redirect -R MyDuplicates -K copy -j jpg source/ target/

  # Interactive with redirect option available
  python op.py -m -D interactive -j jpg source/ target/

  How It Works:

  1. Duplicate Detection: Uses existing comprehensive SHA256 or filename-based detection
  2. Redirect Directory Setup: Creates redirect directory automatically
  3. Intelligent Naming:
    - photo.jpg → photo_duplicate.jpg (if unique)
    - photo.jpg → photo_duplicate_001.jpg (if duplicate keyword name exists)
    - photo.jpg → photo_duplicate_002.jpg (if _001 exists), etc.
  4. Comprehensive Logging: Shows exactly where duplicates were redirected

  Key Features Delivered:

  ✅ Redirect duplicates to designated directory✅ Default "Duplicates" directory in target root✅ Configurable redirect
  directory name/path✅ Default "duplicate" keyword in filenames✅ Configurable duplicate keyword✅ Incremental numbering for
  multiple duplicates✅ Works with both SHA256 and filename-based detection✅ Integration with interactive mode✅ Comprehensive
  logging and user feedback

  Note on Combining Rename + Redirect:

  The current implementation already provides rename + redirect functionality through the redirect mode itself, which:
  - Moves duplicates to the redirect directory (redirect functionality)
  - Renames them with the duplicate keyword and incremental numbers (rename functionality)

  For future enhancement, combo modes like redirect,rename could be added to use traditional numeric renaming (photo_001.jpg) in
   the redirect directory, but the current implementation already meets the core requirement of renaming AND redirecting
  duplicates.

  The redirect functionality is fully implemented and tested, providing a powerful way to organize duplicates separately from
  the main organized files while maintaining clear naming conventions.

● Summary

  Fixed version output appearing multiple times when running without arguments:

  Version Display Bug Fix (v1.5.1):

  1. Problem Identified:
  - Version was appearing 3 times when run without arguments:
    * Once in print statement (line 1151)
    * Once in program name in ArgumentParser
    * Once in custom error handler
  - Created confusing and redundant output

  2. Solution Implemented:
  - Removed version from ArgumentParser prog parameter (now just "op.py")
  - Removed print statement from normal execution flow
  - Enhanced error handler to show clean error messages
  - Added version display only in interactive prompt mode (when neither -m nor -c specified)
  - Version now appears exactly once when run without arguments

  3. Version Tracking Updates:
  - Updated `__version__` from `1.5.0` to `1.5.1` (PATCH version bump for bug fix)
  - Updated date to `2025-10-04`
  - Added version history entry documenting the bug fix
  - Follows semantic versioning standards as specified in CLAUDE.md

  4. Documentation Updates:
  - Updated CLAUDE.md with new version 1.5.1
  - Updated README.md with "What's New in v1.5.1" section
  - Fixed usage examples to reflect cleaner output
  - Updated notes about version visibility

  Output Behavior After Fix:

  # Run without arguments - shows version once
  python op.py
  # Shows: orgphoto v. 1.5.1 2025-10-04
  #        error: the following arguments are required: SOURCE_DIR, DEST_DIR
  #        Try 'op.py --help' for more information.

  # Run with arguments - no version shown (as expected)
  python op.py -c source/ target/
  # Runs normally without version display

  # Interactive mode - shows version
  python op.py source/ target/
  # Shows: orgphoto v. 1.5.1 2025-10-04
  #        Warning: Neither --move nor --copy specified...

  Key Features Delivered:

  ✅ Fixed duplicate version output bug
  ✅ Cleaner error messages
  ✅ Version appears exactly once when appropriate
  ✅ Updated version to 1.5.1 per semantic versioning standards
  ✅ Comprehensive documentation updates across all files

● Summary

  I have successfully implemented version visibility enhancements with the following features:

  Version Display Improvements:

  1. Enhanced Help Output:
  - Version now appears in the help header: `usage: op.py (orgphoto v. 1.5.0 2025-10-02) [options]...`
  - Modified ArgumentParser to include version in the `prog` parameter
  - Provides clear version tracking for all help command usage

  2. Version Display When Run Without Arguments:
  - Created custom `VersionedArgumentParser` class extending argparse.ArgumentParser
  - Override `error()` method to display version before error messages
  - When required arguments are missing, outputs: `orgphoto v. 1.5.0 2025-10-02` followed by error
  - Improves user experience by providing version context even when command is incomplete

  3. Version Tracking Updates:
  - Updated `__version__` from `1.4.1` to `1.5.0` (MINOR version bump for new features)
  - Updated date to `2025-10-02`
  - Added comprehensive version history entry documenting the changes
  - Follows semantic versioning standards as specified in CLAUDE.md

  4. Documentation Updates:
  - Updated CLAUDE.md with new version and features
  - Updated README.md with "What's New in v1.5.0" section
  - Enhanced usage examples to reflect new version display
  - Added note about version visibility improvements

  Usage Examples:

  # Display help with version in header
  python op.py --help
  # Shows: usage: op.py (orgphoto v. 1.5.0 2025-10-02) [options]...

  # Run without arguments - shows version before error
  python op.py
  # Shows: orgphoto v. 1.5.0 2025-10-02
  #        op.py (orgphoto v. 1.5.0 2025-10-02): error: the following arguments are required...

  # Explicit version flag still works
  python op.py --version
  # Shows: op.py (orgphoto v. 1.5.0 2025-10-02) 1.5.0

  Key Features Delivered:

  ✅ Version display in help output header
  ✅ Version display when run without arguments
  ✅ Custom ArgumentParser class for enhanced error handling
  ✅ Updated version to 1.5.0 per semantic versioning standards
  ✅ Comprehensive documentation updates across all files
  ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with existing functionality
  ✅ Improved user experience with consistent version visibility

  Technical Implementation:

  - Custom `VersionedArgumentParser` class inherits from `argparse.ArgumentParser`
